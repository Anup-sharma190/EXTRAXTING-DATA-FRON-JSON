# 📊 JSON Comment Counter  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **JSON Comment Counter** is a Python project that demonstrates how to **fetch, parse, and analyze JSON data** from a web resource.  
The program retrieves a JSON file containing user comments, extracts the `count` values, and calculates:  

- ✅ Total number of comments  
- ✅ Sum of all comment counts  

This project is part of my **Python for Everybody specialization practice** and showcases skills in **web data handling, JSON parsing, and Python scripting**.
